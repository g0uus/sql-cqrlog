I have a mysql with the following table structure:

qsodate date NO MUL
mode varchar(12) NO

write a query to get the number of qsos for each mode on each date.

update the query to summarise by month instead

can you add cumulative counts as well

the table name is cqrlog_main

can you output the results in csv
